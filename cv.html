    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>A highly motivated and hardworking individual, who has taken a very avid interest in computer science and the creation of software. 
        In the past I have undergone training and attained a lot of experience in listening and working with clients, as a result, I understand the importance of client satisfaction. 
        I always aim to do whatever role or task that is assigned to me with integrity whilst ensuring that even my colleagues can work comfortably around me. 
        I also understand the significance of collaboration and team synergy, as most tasks presented to software enigineers are tackled together as a group to find a swift solution. </p>

        <h1>Work experience</h1>

        <p>Crew trainer, Mcdonalds, Central Milton Keynes.
            
            Achievements and responsibilities: 
            
            In charge of training new staff and employees on various stations. As a crew trainer i needed to understand each station and role properly before I communicated it in a way so that it was easy for them to understand and learn.
            Needed to demonstrate a great deal of patience as each person has their own rate of learning.
            Substituted as a manager and managed a portion of the kitchen to myself, whilst demonstrating excellent management skills, as we were ahead on food production and there were no complaints made by customers. </p>

            <p>Sales assistant, CEX Northanpton. As a sales assistant, my main line of duty revolved around boosting sales and helping customers with any queries that they may have.
                I've learned to adapt in many different scenarios when customers request for certain or specific items that must meet their specification. Through this, I've grasped some experience and listening skills when handling requests.
